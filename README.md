## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the RTL source code (SystemVerilog) for a **1024-point Radix-2 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** processor utilizing **IEEE 754 Single Precision Floating-Point (32-bit)** and **Fixed-Point Q16.16 (32-bit)** arithmetic.

This design prioritizes high precision and a wide dynamic range, effectively mitigating the overflow issues often associated with fixed-point implementations. A key feature is the use of a **CORDIC** algorithm to perform complex phase rotations, thereby eliminating the need for expensive hardware multipliers.

This project was developed as a Capstone Project 2 at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)**.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system is designed with a **Fully Pipelined** architecture to maximize throughput:

1.  **Input Buffer:** Implements a Ping-Pong RAM mechanism with a Bit-Reversal address generator to handle continuous input data reordering.

3.  **Butterfly Unit:** Executes standard floating-point addition and subtraction operations.
5.  **CORDIC Rotator:** Replaces complex multipliers by performing vector rotation based on coordinates `(x, y)` and angle `z`.

## 🧪 Verification & Experimental Results

To ensure hardware accuracy, the verification process relies on a **Python Co-Simulation** model:

1.  **Stimulus Generation:**
    Input data is generated using a Python script to simulate a realistic signal containing:
    * Sine waves at **2 kHz** and **10 kHz**.
    * A single-tone noise interference at **24.6 kHz**.
    * Additive White Gaussian Noise.
    This data is quantized into 32-bit Hex format for the Testbench.

2.  **Verification Method:**
    The output frequency spectrum from the RTL Core is compared directly against the reference result calculated by Python's `numpy.fft` library (Golden Reference).

**Results:**
The figure below demonstrates a perfect match between the Python model and the Hardware Core. The RTL Core accurately resolves the **2 kHz and 10 kHz** frequency components and correctly identifies the **24.6 kHz** noise peak with precise magnitude.
